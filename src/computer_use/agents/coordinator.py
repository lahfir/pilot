   - Missing permissions?
   - Apps not installed?

Create a detailed execution plan to achieve this goal:

GOAL: {understanding.intent}

REQUIRED STEPS: {understanding.required_steps}

For each step in your plan, specify:

1. AGENT TYPE: Which agent should handle it?
   - "browser": Web research, downloads, online data extraction
   - "gui": Desktop app interaction, file opening, UI manipulation
   - "system": File operations, terminal commands, organization

2. ROLE: What should this specific agent accomplish? (One clear objective)

3. INSTRUCTIONS: Detailed what to do (will be expanded later)

4. EXPECTED OUTPUT: What should this step produce?
   - File paths if creating files
   - Confirmation messages if verifying
   - Data summaries if extracting

5. DEPENDS ON: Which previous steps does this depend on?

CRITICAL RULES:
- Each step should build on previous work - no duplication!
- Browser agent saves to permanent locations (~/Documents/AgentWorkspace/[task-name]/)
- System agent should use files created by Browser agent, not recreate them
- If task is simple (1-2 steps), don't over-complicate it
- Steps should be in logical order

Example for "Research X and create document":
Step 1 (browser): Research X, save to ~/Documents/AgentWorkspace/research-x/data.md
Step 2 (gui): Open Notes app with data.md, format as document
