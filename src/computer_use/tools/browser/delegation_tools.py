"""Delegation tools for Browser-Use.

These tools allow the Browser-Use autonomous agent to temporarily delegate
OS-native dialog handling (permission prompts, desktop app dialogs) to the 
existing CrewAI GUI specialist agent, then resume browser control.

NOTE: For web file uploads, use browser-use's native upload_file action.
GUI delegation is only needed for truly OS-native dialogs that cannot be
controlled programmatically via the browser.
