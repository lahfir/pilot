# Code Quality Rules

## File Size Limit

- Each file must be less than 400 lines of code (LOC)
- If a file exceeds this limit, refactor by extracting functionality into separate modules
- Break down large functions into smaller, focused functions

## Documentation Standards

- **NEVER** use inline comments (`//` or `#`)
- **ONLY** use docstrings for documentation
- All functions, classes, and modules must have comprehensive docstrings
- Docstrings should explain the purpose, parameters, return values, and any exceptions

## Code Organization

- Write modular and clean code with zero redundancy
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle strictly
- Extract common functionality into reusable utilities
- Use composition over inheritance when possible

## Documentation Reference

- Always refer to official documentation when implementing features
- Do not make assumptions about API behavior
- Verify implementation details against source documentation
- When in doubt, consult the documentation rather than guessing
