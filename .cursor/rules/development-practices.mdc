# Development Practices

## Accuracy and Documentation

- **DO NOT HALLUCINATE** - Only implement what is explicitly requested
- Always refer to official documentation for implementation details
- Verify all assumptions against source documentation
- When implementing APIs or libraries, check the official docs first

## Code Implementation

- Only code what's necessary - avoid over-engineering
- Implement features incrementally and test each step
- Focus on the core functionality first, then add enhancements
- Avoid premature optimization

## Documentation Requirements

- Before implementing any feature, consult the relevant documentation
- Use official examples and patterns from documentation
- If documentation is unclear, ask for clarification rather than assuming
- Reference specific documentation sections when implementing features

## Testing and Validation

- Test implementations against documented behavior
- Validate that code works as documented
- Ensure error handling follows documented patterns
- Verify edge cases are handled according to documentation
