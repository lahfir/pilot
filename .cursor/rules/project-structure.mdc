# Project Structure Rules

## Folder Organization

- Maintain a very clear and modular folder structure
- Use descriptive folder names that reflect their purpose
- Group related functionality together
- Separate concerns into distinct directories

## Directory Structure Guidelines

```
src/
├── components/     # Reusable UI components
├── services/       # Business logic and API calls
├── utils/          # Utility functions and helpers
├── types/          # Type definitions (TypeScript)
├── constants/      # Application constants
├── hooks/          # Custom React hooks (if applicable)
├── pages/          # Page components
└── tests/          # Test files
```

## File Naming Conventions

- Use kebab-case for file names: `user-service.js`
- Use PascalCase for component files: `UserProfile.jsx`
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate purpose
- Avoid abbreviations unless they are widely understood

## Module Organization

- One main export per file
- Use index files for clean imports
- Keep related functionality in the same module
- Avoid circular dependencies
